# SODA-OPT - Enabling System Level Design in MLIR

This project aims to create `soda-opt`, a tool that leverages `mlir` to extract, 
optimize, and translate high-level code snippets into LLVM IR, 
so that they can be synthesized by our high-level synthesis tool of choice.

As a long term vision, the SODA-OPT project seeks to provide a set of
*compiler libraries* to perform the target optimizations; *runtime libraries* 
to offload the compute from host to the selected targets; and to be
*standalone*, being built on top of standard `mlir` tools and dialects, so
that any project (e.i. TF, ONNX, etc) could use the exposed optimization
passes to offload and perform HLS of selected code snippets. As a final
goal, `soda-opt` could later be merged into the main `llvm-project` codebase.


## Getting started

Pull our production image on dockerhub:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/agostini01/soda

And follow one of our tutorials [here](docs/tutorials).


## How to build?

This setup assumes that you have built LLVM and MLIR in `$BUILD_DIR` and
installed it to `$PREFIX`. 
The current version of this project was tested with `llvm-project` commit:
`339a7687e1c036a5f91c9d5391523b93e2e76cd3`.
Make sure you have the correct commit checked-out.

**Note**: Make sure to pass `-DLLVM_INSTALL_UTILS=ON` when building LLVM/MLIR 
with CMake so that it installs `FileCheck`.

To build `soda-opt` and run the tests of this project, execute:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. \
    -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=$BUILD_DIR/bin/llvm-lit \
    -DMLIR_DIR=$PREFIX/lib/cmake/mlir

# Run tests
cmake --build . --target check-soda
```

### Building LLVM/MLIR with Helper Script

LLVM can be built with the helper `build_tools/build_llvm.sh`.

```sh
# To configure, build, and install
./build_llvm.sh <path/to/llvm/src> <llvm_build_dir> <llvm_install_dir>
```

### Building soda-opt with Helper Script

Alternatively it is possible to use the helper script
`build_tools/build_soda.sh` to build this project:

```sh
# To configure, build, and install
./build_tools/build_soda.sh <source_dir> <install_dir> <build_dir> <path/to/llvm/build/dir> <path/to/llvm/install/dir>
```

## How to generate the docs?

To build the documentation from the TableGen description of the dialect
operations, run:
```sh
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```

## How to use this project?

After successful build, available passes can be displayed with:

```sh
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt -h
```

The passes and pipelines described below have several options,
check `soda-opt -h` for additional informaton.


Search passes can be executed with the following command:

```sh
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/soda-opt/linalg-matmul.mlir \
  --convert-linalg-matmul-to-soda

# Other patterns can be marked for outlining with passes following the
# template:
# --convert-<dialect_name>-<op_name>-to-soda
```

Kernel outlining pass can be executed with the following command:

```sh
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/Dialect/SODA/outlining-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-outline-bambu-code

# In the future, searched coded can be outlined for other architectures
# following the pass template: 
# --soda-outline-<target_name>-code
```

The above command can include automatic XML test generation to be
later used during simulation:

```sh
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/Dialect/SODA/outlining-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-outline-bambu-code \
  --soda-extract-arguments-to-xml=using-bare-ptr
# This will generate an xml file for each outlined kernel in the
# folder in which was called
```

Generation/extraction of kernel code exclusive for bambu can be obtained with
the following command:

```sh
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/Dialect/SODA/outlining-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-generate-bambu-accelcode

# In the future, outlined code can be extracted for other target architectures
# following the pass template:
# --soda-generate-<target_name>-accelcode
```

Generation of host code calls to the target accelerator api can be obtained
with the following command:

```sh
# Note this is still under development
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/Dialect/SODA/outlining-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-generate-bambu-hostcode

# In the future, additional host code generation for other accelerator APIs
# will be generated by the following pass template:
# --soda-generate-<target_name>-hostcode
```

Optimizations passes and lowerings can be executed on a `.mlir` file with the
following command:

```sh
# Simply lower all operations to the llvm dialect
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/soda-opt/linalg-matmul.mlir \
  --lower-all-to-llvm

# Perform loop tiling to fit 512KiB "L1" memory
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/soda-opt/linalg-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-opt-pipeline="cache-size=512"

# Specfic pipeline for bambu (with bare pointer call convertion)
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt \
  $PROJ_ROOT_DIR/test/soda-opt/linalg-matmul.mlir \
  --soda-opt-pipeline-for-bambu=use-bare-ptr-memref-call-conv

# Check other options in the -soda-opt-pipeline-for-bambu with
$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/bin/soda-opt -h | less

# In the future, additional pipelines for other target architectures
# will be executed by the following pass template:
 # --soda-opt-pipeline-for-<target_name>
```

To use python bindings, setup python lib path:

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$MLIR_BUILD_DIR/tools/mlir/python_packages/mlir_core
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PROJ_BUILD_DIR/python_packages/soda
```

Import soda libraries like this:

```python
from mlir_soda.ir import *
from mlir_soda.dialects import (
  builtin as builtin_d,
  soda as soda_d
)
```
